# bayanihan
An emergency beacon system that works even without internet connection. By sending the specific location of users to rescuers during times of calamity.

We prioritize SOS requests using bayesian classifiers based on: 
1. message content OR
2. proximity to tall buildings during earthquakes.

The app is designed for these specific scenarios and circumstances:
1. Wide-spread calamity brought about by earthquake or flooding
2. For people who need rescue and owns a smartphone. The app will enable them to request for rescue with one click.
3. For people who own a basic cellphone (non-smartphone) and need to request for rescue via sms.
